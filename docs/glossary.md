#### Acceptance

The process of assessing whether a system satisfies all its requirements.

#### Acceptance criteria

1. The criteria that a work product must satisfy to be accepted by the stakeholders. 2. In agile development: Criteria that the implementation of a backlog item must satisfy in order to be accepted by the stakeholders.

#### Acceptance test

A test that assesses whether a system satisfies its requirements. Note: Typically used by customers or clients to determine whether or not to accept a system.

#### Activity

An action or a set of actions that a person or group performs to accomplish a task.

#### Activity diagram

A diagram type in UML which models the flow of actions in some part of a system, including data flows and areas of responsibility where necessary.

#### Activity model

A model of the flow of actions in some part of a system.

#### Actor

A person in some role, a system or a technical device in the context of a subject under consideration that interacts with that subject. Note: In RE, the subject under consideration typically is a system. In testing, it may be a test object.

#### Adequacy (of a requirement)

The degree to which a requirement expresses the stakeholders’ true and agreed desires and needs (i.e., those they had actually in mind when stating the requirement).

#### Agile

1. In general: a. Able to move quickly and easily. b. Quick, smart, and clever. 2. In software development: A development approach which builds a product incrementally by dividing work into iterations of fixed duration (timeboxes). Note: Agile development is characterized by focusing on delivering a working product in each iteration, collaboration with stakeholders with frequent feedback and adaptation of plans after each iteration based on feedback and changed requirements.

#### Ambiguity

The contrary of →unambiguity.

#### Application domain

Those parts of the real world that are relevant for determining the context of a system.

#### Artifact

Synonym for work product.

#### Association

In UML: A relationship between two classes in a UML class model.

#### Attribute

A characteristic property of an entity or an object.

#### Backlog

→ Product backlog, → sprint backlog. Typically used as a short form for product backlog.

#### Backlog item

An individual element of a backlog. Note: Backlog items include requirements, stories, tasks, features, epics, defects to be fixed, or refactorings to be done.

#### Baseline

A stable, change-controlled configuration of work products. Note: Baselines serve for release planning and release definition as well as for project management purposes such as effort estimation.

#### Behavior

The way in which a system reacts to stimuli, changes its state and produces observable results. Note: Stimuli may be events or changes of conditions. Their origin may be external or system-internal.

#### Behavior model

A model describing the behavior of a system, e.g., by a state machine.

#### Branch

A line of configurations or work product versions that forks away from the main line (or from another branch) at some point in time. Note: A branch is created by making a copy of some configuration or work product version and making this copy the root of the branch. A branch may be merged with the main line or with another branch at some later point in time.

#### Burndown chart

A diagram plotting the work items that remain to accomplish on a time scale.

#### Business requirement

A requirement stating a business goal, objective or need of an organization. Note: Business requirements typically state those business goals, objectives and needs that shall be achieved by employing a system or a collection of systems.

#### Change control board

A committee of client and supplier representatives that decides on change requests. Abbreviation: CCB Note: The Change control board should not be confused with a change advisory board, which is a committee that evaluates change requests for a system in operation and typically has no decision power.

#### Change management

A controlled way to effect or deny a requested change of a work product.

#### Change request

In RE: A well-argued request for changing one or more baselined requirements.

#### Changeability

A diagrammatic representation of a class model.

#### Class model

A model consisting of a set of classes and relationships between them.

#### Client

A person or organization who orders a system, a product or a service to be built. Notes: 1. In most cases, clients are stakeholders. 2. Frequently, the persons or organizations who order a system are different from those who receive the system after it has been built. Therefore, we distinguish between clients and customers.

#### Commonality

The parts of a product line that are shared by all its members.

#### Completeness (of requirements)

1. For a single requirement: The degree to which the specification of a requirement is self- contained. 2. For a work product covering multiple requirements: The degree to which the work product contains all known requirements that are relevant in the scope of this work product.

#### Compliance

The adherence of a work product to standards, conventions, regulations, laws, or similar prescriptions.

#### Component

1. In general: A delimitable part of a system. 2. In software architecture: An encapsulated set of coherent objects or classes that jointly achieve some purpose. 3. In testing: A part of a system that can be tested in isolation. Note: When viewed in isolation, a component is a system by itself.

#### Composition (in a technical context)

1. An item that is composed of a set of items; forming a whole-part relationship. 2. The act of composing a whole from a set of parts.

#### Configuration

A consistent set of logically coherent items. The items are individually identifiable work products or parts of work products in at most one version per item.

#### Context

1. In general: The network of thoughts and meanings needed for understanding phenomena or utterances. 2. Especially in RE: The part of a system’s environment being relevant for understanding the system and its requirements. Note: Context in the second meaning is also called the system context.

#### Context boundary

The boundary between the context of a system and those parts of the application domain that are irrelevant for the system and its requirements. Note: The context boundary separates the relevant part of the environment of a system to be developed from the irrelevant part, i.e., the part that does not influence the system to be developed and, thus, does not have to be considered during Requirements Engineering.

#### Context diagram

A diagrammatic representation of a context model. Note: In Structured Analysis, the context diagram is the root of the dataflow diagram hierarchy.

#### Context model

A model describing a system in its context.

#### Control flow

The order in which a set of actions is executed.

#### Correctness

The degree to which the information contained in a work product is provably true. Note: In RE, correctness is sometimes used as a synonym for adequacy, particularly when validating a requirement rigorously against formally stated properties in the context of a system.

#### Customer

A person or organization who receives a system, a product or a service. Notes: 1. In most cases, customers are stakeholders. 2. Frequently, the persons or organizations who order a system are different from those who receive the system after it has been built. Therefore, we distinguish between clients and customers. 3. “Receiving” includes buying, being provided with and obtaining for free. 4. When customer and client are the same person or organization, the term customer is used in RE contexts.

#### Customer requirements specification

A coarse description of the required capabilities of a system from the customer’s perspective. Note: A customer requirements specification is usually supplied by the customer.

#### Data flow

A sequence of data items flowing from a producer to a consumer.

#### Data flow diagram

A diagrammatic representation of a data flow model. Abbreviation: DFD

#### Data flow model

A model that describes the functionality of a system by activities, data stores and data flows. Note: Incoming data flows trigger activities which then consume the received data, transform them, read/write persistent data held in data stores and then produce new data flows which may be intermediate results that trigger other activities or final results that leave the system.

#### Decision table

A tabular representation of a complex decision, specifying which actions to perform for the possible combinations of condition values.

#### Defect

An imperfection or deficiency in a work product that impairs its intended use. Synonyms: bug, fault

#### Design

1. A plan or drawing produced to show how something will look, function or be structured before it is made. 2. The activity of creating a design. 3. A decorative pattern [This meaning does not apply in the software engineering domain]. Notes: 1. In software product development, we distinguish between creative design which shapes the look and feel of the product, i.e., its perceivable form, function and quality, and technical design (also called software design) which determines the inner structure of the product, in particular the software architecture. 2. The creative design of products is also called product design. 3. The creative design of digital solutions is called digital design.

#### Epic

In agile development: A description of a stakeholder need which is typically larger than what can be implemented in a single iteration. Note: Epics typically represent coarse-grained requirements in a product backlog.

#### Error

1. A human action that produces an incorrect result. 2. A discrepancy between an observed behavior or result and the specified behavior or result. Note: In practice, both meanings are used. Where needed, the meaning of error can be disambiguated by using human error and observed error or observed fault, respectively.

#### Evolutionary prototype

A pilot system forming the core of a system to be developed.

#### Exploratory prototype

A throwaway prototype used to create shared understanding, clarify requirements or validate requirements.

#### Fault tolerance

The capability of a system to operate as intended despite the presence of (hardware or software) faults. Note: Fault tolerance may be stated as a quality requirement.

#### Feasibility (of a requirement)

The degree to which a requirement for a system can be implemented under existing constraints.

#### Feature

A distinguishing characteristic of a system that provides value for stakeholders. Notes: 1. A feature typically comprises several requirements and is used for communicating with stakeholders on a higher level of abstraction and for expressing variable or optional characteristics. 2. In agile development, some approaches denote medium-grained requirements as features.

#### Feature diagram

A diagrammatic representation of a feature model.

#### Feature model

A model describing the variable features of a product line, including their relationships and dependencies.

#### Glossary

A collection of definitions of terms that are relevant in some domain. Note: Frequently, a glossary also contains cross-references, synonyms, homonyms, acronyms, and abbreviations.

#### Goal

A desired state of affairs (that a stakeholder wants to achieve). Note: Goals describe intentions of stakeholders. They may conflict with one another.

#### Goal model

A model representing a set goals, sub-goals and the relationships between them. Note: Goal models may also include tasks and resources needed to achieve a goal, actors who want to achieve a goal, and obstacles that impede the achievement of a goal.

#### Homonym

#### Increment (in software development)

An addition to a system under development that extends, enhances or refactors (refactoring) the existing parts of the system. Note: In agile development, every iteration produces an increment.

#### Inspection

A formal review of a work product by a group of experts according to given criteria, following a defined procedure.

#### Interaction model

A model describing the interaction between a system and its environment or the interaction of items within a system. Note: Scenarios and use cases, for example, model the interaction between a system and its environment. A sequence diagram, for example, can model the interaction between selected objects within a system.

A medium-fidelity prototype that demonstrates characteristics of a user interface without implementing any real functionality. Note: In RE, a mock-up primarily serves for specifying and validating user interfaces.

#### Model

An abstract representation of an existing part of reality or a part of reality to be created. Notes: 1. The notion of reality includes any conceivable set of elements, phenomena, or concepts, including other models. 2. Models are always built for specific purposes in a specific context. 3. With respect to a model, the modeled part of reality is called the original. 4. In RE, requirements can be specified with models.

#### Persona

A fictitious character representing a group of people with similar needs, values and habits who are expected to use a system or benefit from it in a similar way.

#### Phrase template

A template for the syntactic structure of a phrase that expresses an individual requirement or a user story in natural language (→ requirements template, → user story template)

In software and systems engineering: A preliminary, partial realization of certain characteristics of a system. 3. In design: A preliminary, partial instance of a design solution. Notes: 1. In RE, prototypes are used as a means for requirements elicitation (see specification by example) and validation. 2. Prototypes in RE can be classified ▪ with respect to their degree of fidelity into native prototypes, mock-ups and wireframes; ▪ with respect to their purpose into exploratory prototypes and evolutionary prototypes.

#### Prototyping

A process that involves the creation and evaluation of prototypes.

#### Quality

1. In general: The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of an item fulfills requirements. 2. In systems and software engineering: The degree to which a system satisfies stated and implied needs of its stakeholders. Note: Quality in this definition means fitness for intended use, as stated in the requirements. This is in contrast to the colloquial notion of quality which is typically connoted with goodness or excellence.

#### Quality criteria (in RE)

A set of expected qualities of good requirements or good RE work products. Notes: 1. There is no general agreement about which sets of qualities form the quality criteria to be used in RE. 2.

#### Requirements source

The source from which a requirement has been derived. Note: Typical sources are stakeholders, documents, existing systems and observations.

#### Requirements specification

A systematically represented collection of requirements, typically for a system, that satisfies given criteria. Notes: 1. In some situations we distinguish between a customer requirements specification (typically written by the customer) and a system requirements specification or software requirements specification (written by the supplier). 2. Requirements specification may also denote the process of specifying (eliciting, documenting and validating) requirements.

#### Requirements template

A template for specifying requirements. Note: In RE, several forms of templates are used. Phrase templates are used for specifying individual requirements or user stories. Form templates can be used to specify use cases or quality requirements. Document templates provide a predefined structure for requirements documents.

#### Review

An evaluation of a work product by an individual or a group in order to find problems or suggest improvements. Note: Evaluation may be performed with respect to both contents and conformance.

#### Risk

#### Safety

The capability of a system to achieve an acceptable level of probability that the system, under defined conditions, will not reach a state in which human life, health, property, or the environment is endangered. Note: Safety requirements may be stated as quality requirements or in terms of functional requirements.

#### Scenario

1. In general: A description of a potential sequence of events that lead to a desired (or unwanted) result. 2.

#### Semantics

The meaning of a sign or a set of signs in a language.

#### Semi-formal

Something which is formal to some extent, but not completely. Note: A work product is called semi-formal if it contains formal parts, but isn’t formalized totally. Typically, a semi-formal work product has a defined syntax, while the semantics is partially defined only.

#### Sequence diagram

A diagram type in UML which models the interactions between a selected set of objects and/or actors in the sequential order in which those interactions occur.

#### Service

The provision of some functionality to a human or a system by a provider (a system, organization, group or individual) that delivers value to the receiver. Note: In systems engineering, software engineering and Requirements Engineering, services are typically provided by a system for a user or another system.

#### Specification

1. As a work product: A systematically represented description of the properties of an item (a system, a device, etc.) that satisfies given criteria. 2. As a process: the process of specifying (eliciting, documenting and validating) the properties of an item. Note: A specification may be about required properties (requirements specification) or implemented properties (e.g., a technical product specification).

A short narrative describing a piece of required functionality or quality. Notes: 1.

#### Stories may describe

▪ funtionality or quality from a user’s perspective (user story), ▪ required infrastructure functionality or quality, ▪ work items that enable required features or properties of a system. 2. In agile development, stories are frequently considered to be atomic backlog items, that is, items which are not further decomposed in the backlog.

#### Story map

A two-dimensional arrangement of stories or other backlog items. Note: A story map helps understand the functionality of a system, identify gaps and plan releases.

#### Storyboard

A series of sketches or pictures that visualize the execution of a scenario.

#### Structured Analysis

An approach for specifying the functionality of a system based on a hierarchy of data flow diagrams. Data flows as well as persistent data are defined in a data dictionary. A context diagram models the sources of incoming and the destinations of outgoing data flows.

#### Supplier

A person or organization who delivers a product or service to a customer or a client. Synonym A word having the same meaning as another word.

#### Syntax

The rules for constructing structured signs in a language.

#### System

1. In general: A principle for ordering and structuring. 2. In engineering: A coherent, delimitable set of elements that – by coordinated action – achieve some purpose. Notes: 1. A system may comprise other systems or components as sub-systems. 2. The purposes achieved by a system may be delivered by ▪ deploying the system at the place(s) where it is used, ▪ selling/providing the system as a product to its users, ▪ having providers who offer the system’s capabilities as services to users. 3. Systems containing both software and physical components are called cyber-physical systems. 4. Systems spanning software, hardware, people and organizational aspects are called socio- technical systems. Important: In this glossary, system is used as an umbrella term which includes • Products provided to customers, • Services made available to customers, • Other work products such as devices, procedures or tools that help people or organizations achieve some goal, • System components or compositions of systems.

#### System boundary

The boundary between a system and its surrounding context. Notes: 1. The system boundary delimits the system as it shall be after its implementation and deployment. 2. At the system boundary, the external interfaces between the system and its context have to be defined. 3. The system boundary frequently coincides with the scope of a system (which denotes the range of things that can be shaped and designed). However, this is not always the case: there may be components within the system boundary that have to be re-used as they are (i.e., cannot be shaped nor designed), while in the system context there may be things that can be re-designed when the system is developed (which means that they are in scope).

#### System context

The part of a system’s environment that is relevant for the definition as well as the understanding of the requirements of a system to be developed.

#### System requirement

A requirement pertaining to a system.

#### System requirements specification

A requirements specification pertaining to a system. Note: A system requirements specification is frequently considered to be a synonym for requirements specification. Abbreviation: SyRS

#### Task

A coherent chunk of work to be done.

#### Technique

A documented set of coherent actions for accomplishing a task or achieving an objective.

#### Timebox

A fixed, non-extendable amount of time for completing a set of tasks.

#### Tool (in software engineering)

A (software) system that helps develop, operate and maintain systems. Note: In RE, tools support requirements management as well as modeling, documenting, and validating requirements.

#### Traceability

1. In general: The ability to establish explicit relationships between related work products or items within work products. 2. In RE: The ability to trace a requirement • back to its origins, • forward to its implementation in design and code and its associated tests, • to requirements it depends on (and vice-versa).

#### UML

Abbreviation for Unified Modeling Language, a standardized language for modeling problems or solutions.

#### Unambiguity (of requirements)

The degree to which a requirement is expressed such that it cannot be understood differently by different people.

#### Understandability

The degree to which an item is comprehensible to its intended users. Note: Typical items are: a system, a work product, or a part thereof.

#### Usability

The degree to which a system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals in a specified context of use. Note: Usability particularly includes the capability of a system to be understood, learned, used, and liked by its intended users.

#### Use case

A set of possible interactions between external actors and a system that provide a benefit for the actor(s) involved. Note: Use cases specify a system from a user’s (or other external actor’s) perspective: every use case describes some functionality that the system must provide for the actors involved in the use case.

#### Use case diagram

A diagram type in UML that models the actors and the use cases of a system. Note: The boundary between the actors and the use cases constitutes the system boundary.

#### Use case model

A model consisting of a set of use cases, typically together with a use case diagram.

#### User

A person who uses the functionality provided by a system. Note: Users (also called end users) always are stakeholders of a system.

#### User requirement

A requirement expressing a user need. Note: User requirements are typically about what a system should do for certain users and how they can interact with the system. User requirements are a subset of stakeholder requirements.

#### User story

A short narrative describing a need from a user’s perspective together with the expected benefit when this need is satisfied. Also see → story. Notes: 1. User stories are typically written in natural language using the user story template and are usually accompanied by acceptance criteria. 2. In agile development, user stories serve as a user-oriented way to discuss and formulate requirements. They are typically considered to be atomic backlog items, that is, items which are not further decomposed in the backlog (see → story).

#### User story template

A phrase template of the form As a &lt;role/person&gt;, I want &lt;something&gt; so that &lt;benefit&gt;. Notes: 1. Most user stories are written using this template. 2. In agile development, this template is also used for expressing other backlog items that communicate stakeholder needs, for example, epics. 3. Some authors replace &lt;something&gt; by more concrete concepts such as &lt;goal&gt;, &lt;desire&gt;, or &lt;target&gt;.

#### Validation

The process of confirming that an item (a system, a work product or a part thereof) matches its stakeholders’ needs. Note: In RE, validation is the process of confirming that the documented requirements match their stakeholders’ needs; in other words: whether the right requirements have been specified.

#### Variability

1. The degree to which a system can be changed or customized. 2. In product lines: The features that can differ among the members of the product line.

#### Variant

One of the possible forms that an item (e.g., a requirement) may have.

#### Variation point

A point in a product line where an element of the product line (typically a variable or a feature) can be chosen from a set of variants.

#### Velocity

In agile development: The average amount of work that a team is able to complete in an iteration. Note: Agile teams decide how to meaure amount of work. For example, they may measure the average number of stories implemented per iteration, or, if they measure the size of stories with so- called story points, the average number of story points implemented per iteration.

#### Verifiability (of requirements)

The degree to which the fulfillment of a requirement by an implemented system can be verified. Note: Such verification can be performed, for example, by defining acceptance test cases, measurements or inspection procedures.

#### Verification

The process of confirming that an item (a system, a work product, or a part thereof) fulfills its specification. Note: Requirements verification is the process of confirming that the requirements have been documented properly and satisfy the quality criteria for requirements; in other words, whether the requirements have been specified right.

#### Version

An occurrence of an item which exists in multiple, time-ordered occurrences where each occurrence has been created by modifying one of its previous occurrences.

#### View

An excerpt from a work product, containing only those parts one is currently interested in. Note: A view can abstract or aggregate parts of the work product.

#### Viewpoint

A certain perspective on the requirements of a system. Note: Typical viewpoints are perspectives that a stakeholder or stakeholder group has (for example, an end user’s perspective or an operator’s perspective). However, there can also be topical viewpoints such as a security viewpoint.

#### Vision (for a system or product)

A conceptual imagination of a future system or product, describing its key characteristics and how it will create value for its users.

#### Walkthrough

A review in which the author of a work product leads the reviewers systematically through the work product and the reviewers ask questions and make comments about possible issues.

#### Wireframe

A low-fidelity prototype built with simple materials that primarily serves for discussing and validating requirements, design ideas or user interface concepts. Note: When prototyping digital systems, wireframes are typically built with paper. Such prototypes are also called paper prototypes.

#### Work product

A recorded, intermediate or final result generated in a work process. Synonym: Artifact
